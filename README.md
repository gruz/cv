# Intro text

I started web-development in 2001 with pure HTML and later PHP.

In about 2004 I switched to Joomla CMS (it was called Mambo at that time). Joomla extensions have been my main field of work till 2017 and still is an important part of my life.

During that time I have developed and support several joomla extensions, some of which are rather popular. I believe that my joomla extension speak about my skills in the best way. See a little more about my Joomla experience below.

In 2017 I decided to try new technologies and for a short time I got significant experience with Laravel, FreeSwitch, FusionPBX and IP telephony in general, Angular and some new minor experience with other frontend technologies and linux administration.


My Joomla extensions: http://gruz.org.ua/extensions.html

Several of my Joomla extensions:

* MVC Override - override Joomla or extensions classes or methods
* NotificationAry - email on new/updated content
* AjaxModuleLoader - load modules via Ajax
* Crop Fix for PhocaGallery - control thumbnails resize
* AutoReadMore - add Read More break automatically
* LimitArticleEdit - don't allow an Author to edit own article after being published

Some of my Joomla extensions are translated by users into 10+ languages, which indicates it's usefulness.

Linux happy user
