# Joomla part of my life

Though Joomla is not the only and the main thing I work with, it's worth to mention the following:

In about 2004 I started to work with Joomla CMS (it was called Mambo at that time). I have developed and support several joomla extensions, some of which are rather popular and even translated by users into 10+ languages.
